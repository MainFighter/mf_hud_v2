This is abondened if you need help with this version of my HUD I will not provide it.
I abondened this after I scraped everything and remade a new HUD for my server.

Alot of this HUD is broken and has lua errors also some of the settings do not work.

I have sinced fixed all of the errors that are in this HUD in my new one but I really couldn't be fucked going back to update a HUD I will not be using.

Feel free to do whatever you want with it just please leave the credits that I orginally made it, thanks.
